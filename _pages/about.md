# About

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the **[Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/)** (CMDB) program at Johns Hopkins University. I'm a fourth (wow, time flies) year graduate student in the labs of **[Steve Farber](https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/spotlight-farber-lab/)** and **[Will Ludington](https://bse.carnegiescience.edu/dr-william-ludington)**. My research project centers around understanding how lipid absorption occurs in the fruit fly gut and how this process is influenced by bacteria living in that organ (the microbiome).  
As an undergrad at MIT, I studied methylation of flowering plants in the lab of **[Mary Gehring](http://gehringlab.wi.mit.edu)** and developed diagnostic tools for the microbiome in the lab of **[James Collins](https://www.collinslab.mit.edu)** I also participated in an REU at Cornell University in the lab of **[Wojtek Pawlowski](http://pawlowski.cit.cornell.edu)** and a summer internship in Israel via MISTI with **[Jonathan Friedman](https://www.friedmanlab.net)**.  

I'm the author of **[PeakClimber]**(https://github.com/ATiredVegan/PeakClimber), a program for deconvolving HPLC peaks. The GitHub is the best place to access the program, and also the best place to make me aware of any issues with the software. I will continue to update and improve the program at least through the end of my PhD.

# Other 

I'm a former member of the Johns Hopkins and MIT Cross Country teams (**[TFRRS](https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/6082124/Johns_Hopkins/Josh_Derrick.html)**). I still run competitively for **[Falls Road Run Club](https://shop.baltimorerunning.com)** in Baltimore City.  In addition to this, I'm an avid reader and aspiring polyglot. I blog regularly on **[substack](https://deusexvita.substack.com)** about reading, self-analysis, Romance languages, and crunchy things. The blog is cross-posted on this website. My Goodreads **[h-index](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/63766642?sort=review&view=reviews)** (x reviews with at least x likes) is 4. 

# Tutoring
I worked as a Mathnasium tutor in highschool and early college, and tutored 1 on 1 throughout college and grad school. I love teaching and feel qualified to help out with Math, Biology, Literature, and Spanish. Shoot me an email if you are interested and we can set something up on zoom or in person (Baltimore City only).
