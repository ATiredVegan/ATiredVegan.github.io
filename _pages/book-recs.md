One thing I really would have appreciated when I first started learning Spanish was a list of books originally in Spanish, graded by difficulty and grouped by theme. My goal for this page is to be that. I will add to this page as I continue to read. I’ll also make a note of if the audiobook is available.

## Beginner Books 

**Criteria to Start**: This are books I felt like I could read after the Harry Potter series fairly easily. They require completion of at least the Spanish 1K deck, and probably a couple hundred thousand words of graded readers.

### Fantasy 

**[Sendero de los guardabosques](https://www.amazon.com/El-Sendero-del-Guardabosques-19-book-series/dp/B08MPS2K2K)** (España) 

Reviewed: [Book 5](https://deusexvita.substack.com/p/review-9-of-2023-el-refugio-secreto). Books aren't the best quality (repititive, weak MC, little character development), but are absolutely excellent for learning.

All 20 books are on audible. All books are eligible for Kindle Unlimited. 

**[La ciudad de las bestias](https://www.amazon.com/La-Ciudad-Bestias-audiolibro/dp/B07JDFCVRJ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3VELD7PYXYAVI&keywords=ciudad+de+las+bestias&qid=1690580419&sprefix=ciudad+de+las+bestias+%2Caps%2C96&sr=8-1)** and its sequels (Chile/Estados Unidos)

Reviewed: I haven't reviewed these in-depth, but I also can't recommend them. Absolute orientalist crap. I talk a little about both of them in this [blog post](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-mass-immersion-approach-spanish-400-hour-update-c8649f6ab8de). 

Audiobook available 

**[Como agua para chocolate](https://www.amazon.com/Como-agua-para-chocolate-Spanish-ebook/dp/B004774D14/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NEP5X2WP5QUW&keywords=Como+agua+para+chocolate&qid=1690587197&s=digital-text&sprefix=como+agua+para+chocolate%2Cdigital-text%2C114&sr=1-1)** (México)

Reviewed: Not reviewed in-depth, but discussed [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-800-hour-update-3d8349d6af9b). Short, sweet and lyrical.

Audiobook available

**[Memorias de Idhun: La resistencia](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Laura-Gallego-ebook/dp/B086SDVMYC/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=2E0S8HH203RQN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.X19HNykyplt-wmpibSaEDE0FlowEUmYKQe8bg3LDAek9Vmmx87yr0uRIEQF0vkS5.Y6nqrqdVvghU5eSuczz58cNyar9jB-RvxTe0b6cRI6w&dib_tag=se&keywords=la+resistencia+laura+gallego&qid=1754074038&s=digital-text&sprefix=la+resistencia+laura+gallego%2Cdigital-text%2C57&sr=1-1)** (España) 

Reviewed: Not reviewed in-depth, but I think this book is pretty bad. On the level of Fourth Wing. Might be your jam if you like that kind of thing though. 

### Memoir 

**[Cajas de Cartón](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/15rYKab_Kw-Vc4UhWch5qg)** (Estados Unidos)

Reviewed: I haven't reviewed this in-depth, but I recommend it highly. Memoirs of a college professor about his childhood growing up as a migrant farm laborer. I discuss the book a little in this [blog post](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-mass-immersion-approach-spanish-400-hour-update-c8649f6ab8de).

### Non-fiction 

**[Ikagi](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Francesc-Miralles-ebook/dp/B01CJTWTS0/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_es_US=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=215DHF9RVKJGD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._CleEcH7p1gGMRX6v35WqAjnz9V4KrtgOxvb-ulDC8YgvOE3R4kQNbENWVlYgq5Qzf-aI75B-CMsY1CPZMDWtTmkAUrSUsthqwH7hYSgsRhPyxQDnM0iN4mFOwwkt06Hm6OS1ZDfiohco7NyRck5urQRSKsohSF1cYUf2arYeX7kKeEJI3Zdci8L-S9OKfIHp8UDC628sbtBjCU-y-jEhcHXyzT0s97v9hV35YMARtQ.PLR4nLiBTfd3ZXkOJzbDThIzIUuc5kbqDwRsFO2urJA&dib_tag=se&keywords=ikigai&qid=1754074409&s=digital-text&sprefix=ikagi%2Cdigital-text%2C119&sr=1-2)** (España)

Reviewed: I haven't reviewed this in-depth, but this is a perfect beginner book with lots of easy and repetitive vocabulary. The book talks about Ikagi, which is a Japanese philosophy of life. I talk about Ikagi a bit in this [blog post](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-500-hour-update-6cf2b8263a3c). 

Audiobook available 

**[La gran adicción: Cómo sobrevivir sin internet y no aislarse del mundo](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/gran-adicción-sobrevivir-internet-aislarse/dp/8416601542)** (España)

Reviewed: [here](https://deusexvita.substack.com/p/review-1-of-2024-la-gran-addicion). Maximalist critique of internet use.

Audiobook available.

**[Los Cuatro Acuerdos](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/-9Urs_UZO6Sty5-V8_d4GA)** (México)

Reviewed: no in-depth review. Standard self-help spiel under the guise of “ancient toltec wisdom”/ some new-age spirituality. Not a bad idea to read if you’re into that stuff, but honestly nothing special.

Audiobook available.

## Intermediate Books 

**Criteria to Start**: These are what I would call “normal” adult books. Something you might find and read at an airport. I became comfortable with these around ~1000 hours of immersion and around 4 million words of reading.

### Fantasy 

**[Olvidado Rey Gudú](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Olvidado-Gudú-Spanish-María-Matute/dp/8423338061)** (España)

Reviewed: Reviewed in-depth [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/olvidado-rey-gud%C3%BA-best-fantasy-youve-never-read-5a8228fb330a). Absolutely nothing like it in English. Highly recommend. Also recommend a reread at a more advanced level.

Audiobook available

**[La saga de los confines](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/DIAS-DEL-VENADO-SAGA-CONFINES/dp/9877252767/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5GwltknOgCRw8nUycbwJjdokMJlakax1BKeZ4EkFVrrEDr80wTrP16kQ1DjxheX5azH37eEMuQKpBcOCkw5wR1x1g_tMul8vYsvUdYUEYWrIk7Qgw5B9CjqiQ_SGi9Z8B27CtX7Nnoefq_gnRXqrp3l_7SG5F0IFtZVGC82XXQQjq9q4fB9aN9P66NXdAju2OU9ELABPgNgm0Tmor3V6e9UBwqO2umiDBWGlDRhHDcY.vw-D_47lmapYQTVCXPIDQGqm1dFEARvpCCS7amBJZJ8&dib_tag=se&qid=1754075429&refinements=p_27%3ALILIANA+BODOC&s=books&sr=1-3)** (Argentina)

Reviewed: I have no in-depth review of this (still have to finish the third book). This trilogy is a fantasy retelling of the invasion of the Americas with a big dose of Tolkein. The writing can be a little confusing at times, but the plot is very straightforward. 

Audiobook available

### General Fiction

**[Habana año cero](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/4UdsAIPOsR1Qrx3HJ8Qvjg)** (Cuba)

Reviewed: no in-depth review of this guy. Part chic-lit, part noir, this short book was predictable, but painted a vivid picture of the effects of the fall of the Soviet Union on Cuba on levels both personal and political. I found out about this book through Charco Press, which is a British publisher/translator that aims to bring new Latin-American fiction to English readers.

Audiobook available

**[El libro negro de las horas](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=el+libro+negro+de+las+horas&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)** (España)

Reviewed: no in-depth review of this guy. Never have I ever read such a nerdy thriller in my life. This is a book about the criminal underworld surrounding…rare book dealers. Nothing like it that I’ve seen in English.

Audiobook available

### Historical Fiction

**[Africanus](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/5KcoIvk9gATHJgh4qvIGYQ)** (España)
Reviewed: Not reviewed in depth but discussed [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-1100-hour-update-ac3bb7712009). Generally liked Africanus, but it becomes a bit of a slog. Great for learning Roman history though. Also not available in English.

Audiobook available

**[Roma soy yo](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/CwZ5aNjuPb1pyI4LhaV8vA)** (España)
Reviewed: Not in depth, but discuss [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-1000-hour-update-6ab65fe56a71). Recommend much more highly than Africanus, and I don’t think there’s a similar book that focuses on this phase of Caeser’s life.

Audiobook available

**[Maldita Roma](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/CwZ5aNjuPb2D5GhNGYqK4w)** (España)
Reviewed [here](https://deusexvita.substack.com/p/review-2-of-2024-maldita-roma). Very entertaining, but very ridiculously biased in favor of Caesar. Lots of other resources about this time in Caesar’s political career. Plan to write more on this topic soon with an angle towards the duties and pitfalls of historical fiction.

Audiboook available 

**[El guerrero a la sombra del cerezo](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/Y8Eiqbyo5Bi9Lrgrlug-XA)** (España)
Reviewed: Reviewed in depth [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/review-3-of-2023-el-guerrero-a-la-sombra-del-cerezo-3fe2632581c9). Really enjoyed the mystery element of the two plots of this one.

Audiobook available

**[El imperio eres tú](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/El-Imperio-eres-tú-Spanish/dp/8408005278)** (España)
Reviewed: No in-depth review but I thought this was a really interesting way to do historical fiction, blending narrative and textbook-style history. Discussed more [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-900-hour-update-e5350ac70c83).

Audiobook available 

**[La catedral del mar](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/QQxCNFbs1PHCVo-XWSW2-Q)** (España)
Reviewed: Not reviewed in-depth, but I really enjoyed the book and the TV series. Very graphic however. Do not recommend for kids. Discussed [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-800-hour-update-3d8349d6af9b).

Audiobook available

**[Sidi](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/vLbySwv4tafb4-JuqOXfGg)** (España)
Reviewed: Review in Spanish on my Goodreads. This is a (relatively) short book about a short period in the life of the Spanish hero Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, more commonly known as El Cid. I loved the dialogue and descriptions of the battle scenes in this book, but found the character development lacking, and some of the period specific vocabulary difficult. Pérez-Reverte also sometimes writes in the most confusing way.

Audiobook available.

**[Largo petaló de mar](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/UPeceejxZgeC8kunuRPdog)** (Chile/US)
Reviewed: reviewed in-depth [here](https://deusexvita.substack.com/p/review-4-of-2023-largo-petalo-de). Sprawling family saga about the Spanish Civil War, Latin American immigration, and political conflict in Chile. Very manageable in terms of vocab, but a lot of description and little dialogue.
Audiobook Available


**[Violeta](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/vLbySwv4tadwmSqrg7I96w)** (Chile/US)
Reviewed: no in-depth review. Follows the life of Violeta del Valle from 1920 to 2020 (Spanish Flu→ COVID) across a century of tumult in an un-named South American country (which is obviously Chile from the lack of acknowledgement of the Falklands War). I found the main character to be a selfish prick, and the lack of specifics about chilean history to be frustrating, especially compared to the other Allende book on this list.

### Non-fiction

**[No te arrepientas](https://www.amazon.com/No-arrepientas-razones-orgulloso-Historia/dp/8413840147)** (España)
Reviewed: Not reviewed in-depth, but thought was a little too preachy and perhaps too biased. However, nice counterpoint to the standard anti-colonization narratives. A little discussion [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-600-hour-update-72a8980acfc3).

Audiobook available 

**[Una historia de españa](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/KpOw1MVmp25lLFRd_q01rg)** (España)
Reviewed: I haven’t reviewed this in depth, but I don’t like Perez-Reverte’s writing style and I found the jokes to fly completely over my head. I discuss more in this [blog post](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-600-hour-update-72a8980acfc3).

Audiobook available 

**[La gran aventura del reino de asturias](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Jose-Javier-Esparza-ebook/dp/B00692A95O/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=7PEOJLBJPAEN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.BaJ9TgVYD-t57ALjBST9cUuJyInlBrYPTdqZGtcKgj7w2FstKk4paPwOra0NFHUt.KohJyMTB70YxZTJFWpWTmHOF2RZJdEoKY-X8F-qbU4I&dib_tag=se&keywords=La+gran+aventura+del+reino+de+asturias&qid=1754686800&s=books&sprefix=la+gran+aventura+del+reino+de+asturias%2Cstripbooks%2C154&sr=1-1)**(España)
Reviewed I haven’t reviewed this in depth, but this book was too filled with names and dates. I discuss more in this [blog post](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-700-hour-update-eab1867eb69b).

No audiobook available. Kindle Unlimited.


**[Aprendiendo a aprender](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/TpjyBv6Z1g4o5jllYGtxeQ)** (España)
Plenty of similar books in English (Ultralearning, Make it Stick, etc.), but this was an excellent recap for me of science-based learning strategies to help me expand my Spanish vocabulary to the education domain. Bonus points for being originally in Spanish.

Audiobook available


### Science Fiction

**[Hijos del dios binario](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/QQxCNFbs1PGt2l8lB4_w2w)** (España)
Reviewed: in-depth [here](https://medium.com/p/9ef714cf3b67). Recommend highly. One of the few thrillers I have enjoyed over the past few years.

No audiobook available. Kindle Unlimited

**[La invención de Morel](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/QQxCNFbs1PEfcHDp2VvLzw)** (Argentina)
Reviewed in-depth [here](https://medium.com/@deusexvita/dark-souls-la-invenci%C3%B3n-de-morel-and-the-role-of-art-in-society-5cf7d64b4a68). Short, mysterious, and profound.

Audiobook available



**[Cuerpos del verano](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/62urkjw4b84rMZp56DhwYg)** (Argentina)
Reviewed: in-depth [here](https://deusexvita.substack.com/p/review-10-of-2023-los-cuerpos-del). Short, sweet and provocative.

Audiobook available not through Amazon.


## Advanced Books
**Criteria to Start**: Honestly, these are the kind of books that you would struggle with in your native language, so there isn’t a set start point. I wouldn’t tackle until you’ve got at least 4 million words and some intermediate books under your belt.

### Fantasy

**[Cuentos Completos de Jorge Luis Borges](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/3bfSPEKfdTdPjpCDseatOA)** (Argentina)
Reviewed:Haven’t reviewed in depth, but one of the best things I’ve ever read. Hard as fuck though. I discuss in various blog posts [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-800-hour-update-3d8349d6af9b), [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-900-hour-update-e5350ac70c83) and [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-1000-hour-update-6ab65fe56a71).

**[Cien años de soledad por GGM](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/BKDVdXIulNxafzJxUTb7Dw)** (Colombia)

Reviewed: reviewed in-depth [here](https://deusexvita.substack.com/p/review-2-of-2025-cien-anos-de-soledad). This is not really a novel, but a styilized historical retelling of the history of Colombia and I found it very difficult for that reason. Gabo also loves his low frequency vocab. I would read other of his stories, like Crónica, before tackling this one. 

Audiobook available

### Philosophy

**[La Rebelión de las Masas por José Ortega y Gasset](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/oJynxZFvq8d3cJES1QgB9w)** (España)
Reviewed: Reviewed in-depth [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/deusexvita/p/review-5-of-2024-del-sentimento-tragico?r=u4cqu&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true). Was a pretty difficult read, but mainly because of the ideas, although there were numerous Spanish words I was not familiar with. A strident cultural critique of our modern society

** [Del sentimiento trágico de la vida por Miguel de Unamuno](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/eK5xTFXACoYacOoW4F4BUw)** (España)
Reviewed: Reviewed in-depth [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/deusexvita/p/review-5-of-2024-del-sentimento-tragico?r=u4cqu&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true). A difficult read, but mainly because of the quoted philosophers and references, and less so because of the Spanish. I did however, find Unamuno less straightforward than Ortega y Gasset, and thus more difficult to understand.
