# Spanish Literature Recommendations
One thing I really would have appreciated when I first started learning Spanish was a list of books originally in Spanish, graded by difficulty and grouped by theme. My goal for this page is to be that. I will add to this page as I continue to read. I’ll also make a note of if the audiobook is available.

## Beginner Books 

**Criteria to Start**: This are books I felt like I could read after the Harry Potter series fairly easily. They require completion of at least the Spanish 1K deck, and probably a couple hundred thousand words of graded readers.

### Fantasy 

**[Sendero de los guardabosques](https://www.amazon.com/El-Sendero-del-Guardabosques-19-book-series/dp/B08MPS2K2K)** (España) 

Reviewed: [Book 5](https://deusexvita.substack.com/p/review-9-of-2023-el-refugio-secreto). Books aren't the best quality (repititive, weak MC, little character development), but are absolutely excellent for learning.

All 20 books are on audible. All books are eligible for Kindle Unlimited. 

**[La ciudad de las bestias](https://www.amazon.com/La-Ciudad-Bestias-audiolibro/dp/B07JDFCVRJ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3VELD7PYXYAVI&keywords=ciudad+de+las+bestias&qid=1690580419&sprefix=ciudad+de+las+bestias+%2Caps%2C96&sr=8-1)** and its sequels (Chile/Estados Unidos)

Reviewed: I haven't reviewed these in-depth, but I also can't recommend them. Absolute orientalist crap. I talk a little about both of them in this [blog post](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-mass-immersion-approach-spanish-400-hour-update-c8649f6ab8de). 

Audiobook available 

**[Como agua para chocolate](https://www.amazon.com/Como-agua-para-chocolate-Spanish-ebook/dp/B004774D14/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NEP5X2WP5QUW&keywords=Como+agua+para+chocolate&qid=1690587197&s=digital-text&sprefix=como+agua+para+chocolate%2Cdigital-text%2C114&sr=1-1)** (México)
Reviewed: Not reviewed in-depth, but discussed [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-800-hour-update-3d8349d6af9b). Short, sweet and lyrical.

Audiobook available

**[Memorias de Idhun: La resistencia](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Laura-Gallego-ebook/dp/B086SDVMYC/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=2E0S8HH203RQN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.X19HNykyplt-wmpibSaEDE0FlowEUmYKQe8bg3LDAek9Vmmx87yr0uRIEQF0vkS5.Y6nqrqdVvghU5eSuczz58cNyar9jB-RvxTe0b6cRI6w&dib_tag=se&keywords=la+resistencia+laura+gallego&qid=1754074038&s=digital-text&sprefix=la+resistencia+laura+gallego%2Cdigital-text%2C57&sr=1-1)** (España) 
Reviewed: Not reviewed in-depth, but I think this book is pretty bad. On the level of Fourth Wing. Might be your jam if you like that kind of thing though. 

### Memoir 

**[Cajas de Cartón](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/15rYKab_Kw-Vc4UhWch5qg)** (Estados Unidos)
Reviewed: I havne't reviewed this in-depth, but I recommend it highly. Memoirs of a college professor about his childhood growing up as a migrant farm laborer. I discuss the book a little in this [blog post](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-mass-immersion-approach-spanish-400-hour-update-c8649f6ab8de). 

Audiobook available

### Non-fiction 

**[Ikagi](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Francesc-Miralles-ebook/dp/B01CJTWTS0/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_es_US=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=215DHF9RVKJGD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._CleEcH7p1gGMRX6v35WqAjnz9V4KrtgOxvb-ulDC8YgvOE3R4kQNbENWVlYgq5Qzf-aI75B-CMsY1CPZMDWtTmkAUrSUsthqwH7hYSgsRhPyxQDnM0iN4mFOwwkt06Hm6OS1ZDfiohco7NyRck5urQRSKsohSF1cYUf2arYeX7kKeEJI3Zdci8L-S9OKfIHp8UDC628sbtBjCU-y-jEhcHXyzT0s97v9hV35YMARtQ.PLR4nLiBTfd3ZXkOJzbDThIzIUuc5kbqDwRsFO2urJA&dib_tag=se&keywords=ikigai&qid=1754074409&s=digital-text&sprefix=ikagi%2Cdigital-text%2C119&sr=1-2)** (España)

I haven't reviewed this in-depth either, but this is a perfect beginner book with lots of easy and repetitive vocabulary. The book talks about Ikagi, which is a Japanese philosophy of life. I talk about Ikagi a bit in this [blog post](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-500-hour-update-6cf2b8263a3c). 

Audiobook available 

**[La gran adicción: Cómo sobrevivir sin internet y no aislarse del mundo](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/gran-adicción-sobrevivir-internet-aislarse/dp/8416601542)** (España)
Reviewed [here](https://deusexvita.substack.com/p/review-1-of-2024-la-gran-addicion). Maximalist critique of internet use.

Audiobook available.

**[Los Cuatro Acuerdos](https://www.charmcitybooks.com/item/-9Urs_UZO6Sty5-V8_d4GA)** (México)
Standard self-help spiel under the guise of “ancient toltec wisdom”/ some new-age spirituality. Not a bad idea to read if you’re into that stuff, but honestly nothing special.

Audiobook available.
