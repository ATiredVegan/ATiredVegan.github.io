# Spanish Literature Recommendations
One thing I really would have appreciated when I first started learning Spanish was a list of books originally in Spanish, graded by difficulty and grouped by theme. My goal for this page is to be that. I will add to this page as I continue to read. I’ll also make a note of if the audiobook is available.

## Beginner Books 

**Criteria to Start**: This are books I felt like I could read after the Harry Potter series fairly easily. They require completion of at least the Spanish 1K deck, and probably a couple hundred thousand words of graded readers.

### Fantasy 

**[Sendero de los guardabosques](https://www.amazon.com/El-Sendero-del-Guardabosques-19-book-series/dp/B08MPS2K2K)** (España) 

Reviewed: [Book 5](https://deusexvita.substack.com/p/review-9-of-2023-el-refugio-secreto). Books aren't the best quality (repititive, weak MC, little character development), but are absolutely excellent for learning.

All 20 books are on audible. All books are eligible for Kindle Unlimited. 

**[La ciudad de las bestias](https://www.amazon.com/La-Ciudad-Bestias-audiolibro/dp/B07JDFCVRJ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3VELD7PYXYAVI&keywords=ciudad+de+las+bestias&qid=1690580419&sprefix=ciudad+de+las+bestias+%2Caps%2C96&sr=8-1)** and its sequels (Chile/Estados Unidos)

Reviewed: I haven't reviewed these in-depth, but I also can't recommend them. Absolute orientalist crap. I talk a little about both of them in this [blog post](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-mass-immersion-approach-spanish-400-hour-update-c8649f6ab8de). 

Audiobook available 

**[Como agua para chocolate](https://www.amazon.com/Como-agua-para-chocolate-Spanish-ebook/dp/B004774D14/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NEP5X2WP5QUW&keywords=Como+agua+para+chocolate&qid=1690587197&s=digital-text&sprefix=como+agua+para+chocolate%2Cdigital-text%2C114&sr=1-1) (México)
Reviewed: Not reviewed in depth, but discussed [here](https://medium.com/language-hub/refold-approach-to-language-learning-spanish-800-hour-update-3d8349d6af9b). Short, sweet and lyrical.
